# myProjects

These are a few projects I've worked on! You can find instructions for how to run them in the README.txt within each project.
The crosswordGA uses a genetic algorithm to evolve to make a viable crossword puzzle. It starts with an input of an empty grid, where some squares in the grid will represent spaces where the puzzle can place letters, and some squares in the grid contain black squares (places where letters cannot be placed). The output is a grid filled in with words and black squares.
BrickBreaker is a game where the player has to try and "break" all the bricks by hitting them
with a ball. If the player loses too many balls, they lose.
