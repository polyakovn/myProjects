These are a few projects I've worked on! 
The WebApp is a restaurant finder that uses the Yelp API. The user can find a restaurant by filtering
by certain criteria (like type of food and location).
BrickBreaker is a game where the player has to try and "break" all the bricks by hitting them
with a ball. If the player loses too many balls, they lose.
